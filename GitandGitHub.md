# Introduction to Git and GitHub 😜

### What I've learned 😁  
How to connect my remote repository to my local one and push files from the local repo to the remote one, allowing the rest of my team and the public(potentially) to review source code 
The significance of github in software development and how we can use Git to improve productivity and eficency 

### What I'm confused about 🤔 
I physically tried to create this markdown file using the command line then push it to this exercises repo but got this error message: remote: Permission to cbfacademy/github-fundamentals-Teyiowuawi.git denied to spilledsoju.fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/cbfacademy/github-fundamentals-Teyiowuawi/': The requested URL returned error: 403
i am guessing this is because I don't have an SSH Key and this isnt my actual repository?
